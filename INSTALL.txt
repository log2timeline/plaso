# Small INSTALL file.
# This is more of a scratch pad than anything else, and will most likely either be completely removed or changed when the installation has
# actually been succesful.
#   (most likely removed and put on the actual site page instead of here in the code).


Mac OS X:

+ libregf (remember to use ./configure --enable-python)$ and remember to read the README.macosx
+ pytsk3 (http://code.google.com/p/pytsk/wiki/Installing)

Actual Work:
1. Get this repo, check.
2. Download protobuf: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list (http://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-2.4.1.tar.bz2)
