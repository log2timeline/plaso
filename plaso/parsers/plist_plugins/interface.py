Plist files are only one example of a type of object that the Plaso tool is

  The following are the attributes and methods expected to be overridden by a

  Attributes:
  PLIST_PATH - string of the filename the plugin is designed to process.
  PLIST_KEY - list of keys holding values that are necessary for processing.

  Please note, PLIST_KEY is cAse sensitive and for a plugin to match a
  plist file needs to contain at minimum the number of keys needed for
  processing or WrongPlistPlugin is raised.

  For example if a Plist file contains the following keys,
  {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2, 'opt': 3} with 'foo' and 'bar' being keys critical to
  processing define PLIST_KEY as ['foo', 'bar']. If 'opt' is only optionally
  defined it can still be accessed by manually processing self.top_level from
  the plugin.

  Methods:
  GetEntries() - extract and format info from keys and yields event.PlistEvent.

    This is the main method that a plist plugin needs to implement.

    The contents of the plist keys defined in PLIST_KEYS will be made available
    to the plugin as self.matched{'KEY': 'value'}. The plugin should implement
    logic to parse this into a useful event for incorporation into the Plaso
    timeline.

    For example if you want to note the timestamps of when devices were
    LastInquiryUpdated you would need to examine the bluetooth config file
    called 'com.apple.bluetooth' and need to look at devices under the key
    'DeviceCache'.  To do this the plugin needs to define
    PLIST_PATH = 'com.apple.bluetooth' and PLIST_KEYS =
    frozenset(['DeviceCache']). IMPORTANT: this interface requires exact names
    and is case sensitive. A unit test based on a real world file is expected
    for each plist plugin.

    When a file with this key is encountered during processing self.matched is
    populated and the plugin's GetEntries() is called.  The plugin would have
    self.matched = {'DeviceCache': [{'DE:AD:BE:EF:01': {'LastInquiryUpdate':
    DateTime_Object}, 'DE:AD:BE:EF:01': {'LastInquiryUpdate':
    DateTime_Object}'...}]} and needs to implement logic here to extract
    values, format, and produce the data as a event.PlistEvent.

    The attributes for a PlistEvent should include the following:
      root = Root key this event was extracted from. E.g. DeviceCache/
      key = Key the value resided in.  E.g. 'DE:AD:BE:EF:01'
      time = Date this artifact was created in microseconds(usec) from epoch.
      desc = Short description.  E.g. 'Device LastInquiryUpdated'
