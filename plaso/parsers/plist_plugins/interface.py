  Please note, PLIST_KEY is cAse sensitive and for a plugin to match a

  processing define PLIST_KEY as ['foo', 'bar']. If 'opt' is only optionally

    applicability). This level is suitable for most cases.

    For cases where there is variability in the name at the first level
    (e.g. it is the MAC addresses of a device, or a UUID) it is possible to
    override the depth limit and use GetKeys to fetch from a deeper level.

    E.g.

    This is the main method that a plist plugin needs to implement.

    The contents of the plist keys defined in PLIST_KEYS will be made available
    to the plugin as self.matched{'KEY': 'value'}. The plugin should implement
    logic to parse this into a useful event for incorporation into the Plaso
    timeline.

    For example if you want to note the timestamps of when devices were
    LastInquiryUpdated you would need to examine the bluetooth config file
    called 'com.apple.bluetooth' and need to look at devices under the key
    'DeviceCache'.  To do this the plugin needs to define
    PLIST_PATH = 'com.apple.bluetooth' and PLIST_KEYS =
    frozenset(['DeviceCache']). IMPORTANT: this interface requires exact names
    and is case sensitive. A unit test based on a real world file is expected
    for each plist plugin.

    When a file with this key is encountered during processing self.matched is
    populated and the plugin's GetEntries() is called.  The plugin would have
    self.matched = {'DeviceCache': [{'DE:AD:BE:EF:01': {'LastInquiryUpdate':
    DateTime_Object}, 'DE:AD:BE:EF:01': {'LastInquiryUpdate':
    DateTime_Object}'...}]} and needs to implement logic here to extract
    values, format, and produce the data as a event.PlistEvent.

    The attributes for a PlistEvent should include the following:
      root = Root key this event was extracted from. E.g. DeviceCache/
      key = Key the value resided in.  E.g. 'DE:AD:BE:EF:01'
      time = Date this artifact was created in number of micro seconds
             (usec) since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
      desc = Short description.  E.g. 'Device LastInquiryUpdated'
