    completion_time (int): time that the task was completed. Contains the
        number of micro seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
    file_entry_type (str): dfVFS type of the file entry the path specification

    has_retry (bool): True if the task was previously abandoned and a retry
        task was created, False otherwise.
    identifier (str): unique identifier of the task.
    last_processing_time (int): the last time the task was marked as being
        processed as number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
