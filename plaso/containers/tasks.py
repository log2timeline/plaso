  """Task attribute container.

  A task describes a piece of work for a multi processing worker process
  for example a task to process a path specification or to analyze an event.

  Attributes:
    aborted (bool): True if the task was aborted.
    completion_time (int): time that the task was completed. Contains the
        number of micro seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
    file_entry_type (str): dfVFS type of the file entry the path specification
        is referencing.
    has_retry (bool): True if the task was previously abandoned and a retry
        task was created, False otherwise.
    identifier (str): unique identifier of the task.
    last_processing_time (int): the last time the task was marked as being
        processed as number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
    merge_priority (int): priority used for the task storage file merge, where
        a lower value indicates a higher priority to merge.
    path_spec (dfvfs.PathSpec): path specification.
    session_identifier (str): the identifier of the session the task is part of.
    start_time (int): time that the task was started. Contains the number
        of micro seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
    storage_file_size (int): size of the storage file in bytes.
    storage_format (str): the format the task results are to be stored in.
