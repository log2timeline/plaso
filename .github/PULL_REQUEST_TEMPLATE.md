## This is almost always the wrong way to submit code to Plaso
 
All code for Plaso goes through [code review](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Codereview),
and conforms with the Plaso [style guide](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Style-guide).
Please don't send a pull request without creating a code review issue first!
