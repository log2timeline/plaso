## This is almost always the wrong way to submit code to Plaso

All contributions to Plaso undergo [code 
review](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Codereview). This makes sure
that the code has appropriate test coverage and conforms to the Plaso [style
guide](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Style-guide).

Please don't send a pull request without a corresponding code review issue!
